== Introduction

Software development is a creative work and as such it's very sensitive to
formalizations. However, it is important to have some guidance about how the
work is usually done, how information flows and what actions are taken in
reccurrent situations.

This document describes a low overhead, flexible and structured process to guide
contributors on the development of OSIS. It doesn't impose rules, but
communicates how the team usually behaves in every foreseen situation.

The process is inspired on agile and lean practices adapted to the context of a
large education institution and open source development. It is constantly
improved as contributors become more autonomous and tasks automated.

=== The Fundamental Principles

==== Traceability

When an event occurs, it is easily possible to identify what needs attention,
where it is located, who has changed it and when.

==== Previsibility

The team is so reliable and known that their working behavior is predictable and
they know by heart the effort to do anything.

==== Reactivity

Everyone in the team knows how everything works, so they can easily resume a
work in progress or assume new responsibilities. They work with the same
environment and configuration, so they can easily reestablish operations.

==== Measurability

Everything must be quantifiable to enable measurements. They can set goals and
be compared. We manage better what we can measure.

=== Communication

For being open source, the communication strategy changes from the traditional
internal communication to a global and transparent one. People should consider
not only the participation of the internal team, but also developers and users
all around the world. Therefore, to allow global and transparent communication,
we have to comply with the following rules:

 1. Communication directed to the local community can be done in English or in
    the native language.
 2. Communication directed to the global community should be done in English
    only.
 3. The code should be written in English only.
 4. The user interface is multilingual but it will initially support English and
    French. The support for additional languages depends on the adoption of the
    software and the contributions from the community.
 5. Since there is not private source, all the communication is done using
    public channels such as mailing lists, chats, wikis and others.
 6. To be taken into account, a communication should be registered textually and
    preserved historically. Direct email communication between two or a subset
    of the team is not considered valid because all stakeholders should be
    equally informed.

To support the communication rules, we have created the following channels:

The team that maintains the context-free module communicates through the chat
https://gitter.im/uclouvain/OSIS in English only.

The team that discusses the context-specific module communicates through the
chat https://gitter.im/uclouvain/OSIS-Louvain in English or in French, the local
native language.

The development community communicates through the group
https://groups.google.com/d/forum/osis-dev in English only.

The users community communicates through the group
https://groups.google.com/d/forum/osis-user in English or in French.

News about the project can be found at: http://uclouvain.github.io/OSIS/.

Development statistics about the project can be found at
https://www.openhub.net/p/OSIS.

Organizations that support the development of OSIS through a context-specific
module can follow their own internal rules of communication.

=== The Process

Our software methodology is composed of 4 processes: *Analysis*, *Development*,
*Test*, and *Support*. These processes run in two parallel iterations and one
on-demand execution.

image::images/overview.png[Overview]

The iteration of the analysis lasts for 2 weeks. This iteration is independent
from the development, so analysts do not have to wait for the outcome of the
development to advance with their analysis. It also means that we expect a
release coming out from each iteration, just like application releases.
Therefore, the analysis should be planned, executed, integrated, tested and
released, as traditionally done with code.

Development and test are in the same iteration because everything that is
developed should be tested before going into production. The tests should be
done by someone else not directly involved on the development of the ongoing
version. This iteration also lasts from 2 weeks and occurs in the same time
frame of the analysis. The output of the analysis serves as input for the
development and test. However, the output is accumulated in a backlog before
being allocated in the upcoming development iterations.

The support is an on-demand process, executed only when an issue in production
is reported. Every issue starts an independent instance of the process. There is
no fixed duration of the execution, but it has higher priority than other
processes and the minimal waiting time is 12 working hours.

More details about each one of these processes are described in the following
sections.

=== Roles

User:: All those who use the application or lead other users. They can also be
representatives of a larger group of users. They should transmit to analysts the
maximum amount of information possible about the need they have and be available
for questions and meetings as demanded by analysts once a RFC is created, in
order to minimize the impact on the schedule. Users can only contact analysts.
If they contact anybody else in the team, they risk to have their demand
ignored.

Analyst:: Responsible for documenting how the business works and translating the
documentation into application functionalities. They produce the business
process models and the user manual. The analysts are the only ones authorized to
contact the users. If anybody else contact the user directly they risk to break
the chain of traceability.

Technical Leader:: Responsible for the leadership of the development team. It's
the leader who create the tickets based on the RFCs, plan the releases and
distribute the work among developers. The leader should also monitor the project
to detect and fix non-conformities, identify deficiencies that impact the team's
productivity and act to overcome those deficiencies. The technical leader can
only talk to a user if followed by an analyst.

Developer:: Responsible for developing the application according to the
instructions in the user manual. They have the technical knowledge to transform
business needs into application features, but they do not necessarily have
business knowledge because they should always rely on the user manual. It makes
possible that any developer is capable of developing any part of the application
even if s/he know nothing about it.

Tester:: Responsible for making sure the application behaves exactly as foreseen
in the user manual. They have the technical knowledge to create test scripts to
automate tests, checking whether everything works fine after every introduced
change.

Supporter:: Responsible for the support for users, explaining them how to use
the application if the user manual is not sufficiently clear. In the case the
application  is not behaving as expected, the supporter is responsible for
reproducing the problem and create a high priority issue to be addressed by
developers.

=== Artefacts

Process:: A graphical model that describes what is done, by whom and  in which
sequence.

User Manual:: Documentation maintained by analysts to describe how the process
is executed and how the application helps on the matter.

Technical User Manual:: Documentation maintained by developers to describe the
domain model and other technical aspects of the system.

Schedule:: A high level view of the project evolution in time. It is useful to
analyze the impact of a delay on the final delivery date.

Source Code:: Low level instructions, written according to the grammars of
chosen programming languages, that technically describe how the application is
expected to work and actually run it after compiled/interpreated.

=== Tools

AsciiDoctor:: A tool that interprets AsciiDoc instructions and generates stylish
documents in different formats (html, pdf, etc.).

Atom:: A text editor suitable to write AsciiDoc documents.

Git:: A distributed version control system used to version the documentation
produced in the project.

GitHub:: An online Git service that adds an issue tracking system, a wiki and a
collaborative code platform to Git.

Jenkins:: An automation tool to implement continuous integration and delivery
practices for Java applications.

PyCharm:: A Python programming IDE.

Visual Paradigm:: A modeling tool used to materialize the abstractions behind
the data model, the business process, the software user interface, and many
others.

== Analysis

Analysis is the part of the process that continuously investigates and document
how the business work. The documentation assumes the format of a user manual.

The user manual describes how the application works. So, instead of producing
several documents, the analysts concentrate all their effort in a single one,
written in a way that serves both the development team and the users.

Writing the user manual before developing the application is not an unusual
idea. In Test-Driven Development (TDD) developers are motivated to write the
tests before reaching the code. The practice of doing useful things in advance
is a form of continuous reasoning about what will be done in the code, which is
the ultimate artifact to be delivered to users.

=== Report a business need

The user can request new features or modifications in the application. It can be
done in many different ways because it is not formalized. Users and analysts are
free to decide how they will communicate. This is a moment to listen to the
users, without interfering their way of thinking.

=== Verify the impact on business processes

In order to identify the impact on existing processes, the analyst should locate
in the processes where the new business need applies. For that, the analyst asks
the user about the roles involved, what they do, in which sequence, what they
need, what they deliver and how they transform their needs into deliverables.

Users requests should be aligned with what already exists in terms of processes.
They should contribute to improve existing processes or add new processes
connected to existing ones. Requests that are not aligned with existing
processes or propose isolated processes must be rejected until the application
evolves to a point that those requests can be connected.

=== Create request for change

When a context is found for the request then a ticket is created to track the
changes. This ticket is also called RFC (Request For Change) and is allocated to
an analyst who will proceed with the analysis.

RFCs are managed in the repository
https://github.com/uclouvain/osis-louvain-documentation/issues.

A RFC must contain:

- A *title* that summarizes in one sentence the content of the change;
- A detailed *description* of the change;
- The *analyst* responsible for the analysis of the change;
- The *user* who requested the change;
- The *full path to the process element* that is impacted by the change.

A RFC is the equivalent of a user story. A user story is a description of what
the user expects from the application in order to produce a certain outcome for
the organization.

=== Modify the impacted business processes

A RFC allows the analyst to modify artifacts, such as the business process
model. The number of the RFC is required to identify the version of the modified
artifact in the version control system.

Modifications in the processes do not necessarily imply on modifications in the
application. Some activities are automated in the application and others are
manual. Therefore, a change may modify the process and the application or only
the process or only the application.

If the processes don't change, then this activity is irrelevant.

=== Create a new business process

Sometimes the user request requires the creation of a new business process. The
criteria to create a new process are extensive and sometimes subjective. In
general, if the request does not fit in an existing process or it requires
substantial amount of work then it is a potential candidate for a new process.
In any case, it is not a simple decision and it needs to be extensively
discussed with users.

=== Review business process

The user should review the process and approve it in order to move forward.
Otherwise, analysts and users keep adjusting the process until it is in
condition to be approved.

=== Describe the execution of the process

During this activity, the analyst is actually writing the user manual. It should
describe the process as a whole, not only the automated activities. Activities
performed manually are described shortly and activities automated by the
application are described into details. The details include the definition of
the activity, its inputs and outputs, the wireframes representing the user
interface, and a sequence of steps about how to use them.

=== Review the execution of the process

The users should read the manual to make sure they understand the illustrations
and the instructions. If they do not approve it, then analysts and users keep
adjusting the manual until it is in condition to be approved.

=== Verify technical feasibility

Before entering in the development cycle, the changes in the user manual are
validated by the technical leader to make sure they are technically feasible. In
case of problems, the technical leader discusses with analysts until they find a
workable solution.

== Development

image::images/development.png[Development]

=== Create work breakdown structure
=== Create requests for change

These are the states of requests for change:

- *Created*: A ticket is created but not yet planned.

- *Assigned*: An existing ticket is assigned to a person and a milestone.

- *Finished*: The assigned person has finished the work as described in the
  ticket.

- *Tested*: The tester has validated the work done in the ticket.

- *Closed*: The technical leader has considered the ticket closed and ready to
  be released.

- *Canceled*: The ticket was created by mistake.

=== Demand developers estimations
=== Estimate requests

These are the types of effort:

- *Unknown*: the team does not have the necessary knowledge to address the
  issue. Therefore, an investigation should be carried out and no extimation can
  be done.

- *Complex*: the team has the necessary knowledge to address the issue but
  cannot estimate when the work will be finished.

- *Heavy*: the team has the necessary knowledge to address the issue and
  estimate the work but the issue cannot be solved in less than 5 working days.

- *Regular*: the team has the neccessary knowledge to address the issue and
  estimate the work but the issue cannot be solved in less than 2 days.

- *Easy*: the team has the necessary knowledge to address the issue, estimate
  the work and finish it in less than 2 days.

- *Flash*: the issue can be solved in a couple of hours.

=== Distribute requests in upcoming iterations

The distribution of requests is done to a maximum of 3 sprints: The one that is
about to start and the two upcoming ones. The reasons why we cannot have more
than three sprints are:

- Old tickets tend to be forgotten. In practice, new tickets are created to
  solve a problem and when old tickets are revisited we finally notice they are
  duplications of more recent tickets.

- Increase the management cost by adding more control mechanisms. For instance:
  the tickets must be revisited often to not be forgotten or duplicated.

- Accumulation of non-planned tickets, which may freeze the size of the backlog.

These are the types of priority:

- *Blocking*: The application is blocking the work of a user who may not
  complete his/her task on time. This is usually due to a bug and must be fixed
  as soon as possible.
- *Essential*: It must have. It is so crucial to have the functionality
  implemented that the process couldn't run without it.
- *Important*: It should have. The user can live without it, but his/her
  productivity is heavily impacted.
- *Desirable*: It is nice to have. An existing functionality can be improved, so
  a user can perform his/her tasks faster.
